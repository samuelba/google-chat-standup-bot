# Google Chat Standup Bot

This is a Google Chat bot for Google Workspace to ask the users the ~~three~~ defined standup questions. 
After the questions have been answered, the bot will publish the answers as a card to the group chat of the team. 
The standup questions can be either triggered automatically by a user configurable schedule, or manually by the user.

**Features**

* Supports different teams
* Bot publishes the standup answers to the team room
* Users can configure their own schedules, at which days and time they want to get a standup notification
* The questions are configurable per team
* The user can redo the standup questions, and the answers card will be updated in the team room
